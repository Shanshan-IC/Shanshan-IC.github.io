描述[#1399 : Shortening Sequence](https://hihocoder.com/problemset/problem/1399)

## Description

There is an integer array A1, A2 ...AN. Each round you may choose two adjacent integers. If their sum is an odd number, the two adjacent integers can be deleted.

Can you work out the minimum length of the final array after elaborate deletions?

## Input and Output

输入

> The first line contains one integer N, indicating the length of the initial array.
>
> The second line contains N integers, indicating A1, A2 ...AN.
>
> For 30% of the data：1 ≤ N ≤ 10
>
> For 60% of the data：1 ≤ N ≤ 1000
>
> For 100% of the data：1 ≤ N ≤ 1000000, 0 ≤ Ai ≤ 1000000000

输出

> One line with an integer indicating the minimum length of the final array.

样例提示

```
(1,2) (3,4) (4,5) are deleted.

```

## Codes

The ideas: After multiple deletion, in the end there are only all evens or odds. So just calculate the number differences between the evens and the odds.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int count = 0;
    int n, a;
    cin >> n;
    while (n--) {
        cin >> a;
        if (a%2 ==0)
            count++;
        else
            count--;
    }
    cout << (count>0?count:-count) << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
