Python Tutorial

Python is a very simple language, and has a very straightforward syntax. Python uses indentation for blocks, instead of curly braces. Both tabs and spaces are supported, but the standard indentation requires standard Python code to use four spaces.

* Input and Output
{% highlight Python %}
print 'hello, world'
{% endhighlight %}
