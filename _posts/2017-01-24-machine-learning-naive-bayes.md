Naive Bayes Algorithms

1. The foundation: Probabilistic model

Abstractly, naive Bayes is a conditional probability model: given a problem instance to be classified, represented by a vector {\displaystyle \mathbf {x} =(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n})} {\mathbf  {x}}=(x_{1},\dots ,x_{n}) representing some n features (independent variables), it assigns to this instance probabilities
