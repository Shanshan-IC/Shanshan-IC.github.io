Naive Bayes Algorithms

1. The foundation: Probabilistic model

Abstractly, naive Bayes is a conditional probability model: given a problem instance to be classified, how to calculate P(B|A) when P(A|B) is known. Bayes Probability terminology:

![](/images/ML/bayes1.png)

2.  Knowledgement and Process

The sample belongs to the type with the highest probability. The definition is:

a. ![](/images/ML/bayes2.png) is the features data, a means x's every feature

b. Multiple classes: ![](/images/ML/bayes3.png)

c. Calculate conditional Probabilistic: ![](/images/ML/bayes4.png)

d. If ![](/images/ML/bayes5.png), then ![](/images/ML/bayes6.png)
