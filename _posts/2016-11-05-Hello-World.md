Hello World!

What is the coder's worst nightmare? 

1. Code works perfectly after the first try. The starts are not even aligned today.

2. Favorite coffee shop is closed.

3. Client from hell.

4. Hey, I have an awesome idea that can change the world, you can code it for me, and I'll give you 30% of the company. 

5. This is the computer genius I told you about.
